<h1>Case Study: Recovery Team<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt;font-weight:normal'>(2002)</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>With 6 months to go
in an 18-month schedule we calculated that the project would be 2 months
late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We based this on the current team
velocity and on release planning estimates for the main C++ based XP team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The 2-month slippage
was communicated 3 months previously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But now the recalculated finish date confirmed to management that
something needed to be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So we
determined that the last 4 stories in the release could be implemented
separately while using a technology new for the company.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The new team was the recovery plan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was the Recovery Team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The manager was very
happy with the high productivity and team spirit of the main C++ team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>And we all agreed
that the main C++ XP team should not be disturbed and a separate team should be
started from scratch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This would help
us avoid the perils of Brooks law:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Adding
people to a late project will make it later</i>. We were adding a separate team
to a late project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was possible
because XP handles one feature (or Story) at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The later stories remained independent enough to break off and
assign to another team. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Yet there were a
number of concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The company had
never deployed a Java server application and no programmers were currently
available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time programmers
arrived we had a little more than 2 months to deliver the application.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were new to the company, and new to XP,
but they had experience with Java and IBM-VisualAge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>As coach I
introduced the XP process to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
started writing tests, and began to work out our integration cycle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The team actually started before PC’s were
available so we worked on whatever equipment was available that day (or even
half-day).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The Customer team was made
up of two functional experts, a test coordinator, and a very knowledgeable
government employee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The functional
experts and the government employee were each only available 2-days a week,
while the test coordinator was primarily busy with the main C++ project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>It was originally
assumed that the requirements were well understood.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The 4 stories were a re-implementation of an existing mainframe
application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The goal was to move it to
a Unix server.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The team held an
Exploration meeting that gave a basic scope to the project.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Next we moved into our iteration #1 planning
game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The goal was to estimate enough
work for one first week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
programmers were a little lost at this point because so much was unclear at the
same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The team had never used XP:
they had never programmed in test-first style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They had never integrated every hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And they were quite suspicious of the value of Refactoring.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of these are normal start-up
reactions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>We were all conscious that
the time frame was very short.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
worried that one simple step at a time would not get us to completion in 2
months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I worried that they may not
learn the XP style in time for the productivity boost to kick–in during this
short timeframe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time it takes
before the productivity boost begins is not related to programmer skill.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is related to programmer acceptance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Until the tests are being written with care
and focus no programmer will believe that Refactoring can be so effective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The original list of
4 stories tuned out in the end to be 9 stories.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The original 4 were broken into smaller Stories and additional
Stories were added to handle issues of concurrency and data-clean-up that did
not exist on the mainframe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As so often
happens requirements that appear well defined at the beginning need to be
adjusted when the details of implementation are considered.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>XP agility is a good answer to this
phenomenon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But while the list of
stories grew, the velocity of the team did too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The main project
risk was that the company had not yet delivered a Java application into
production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A concurrent 40-person
project named HGWF for Home-Grown Water-Fall (not it’s real name) had been
trying to solve numerous Java production questions for the last 10 months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The customer wanted to know how my small
team could deliver in 2 months what HGWF could not do in 10!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Since this was the first concern, we made
it the first story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We built a “Hello
World” program and moved it though all the steps needed to get it into
production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We moved the source code
from VisualAge Repository to a Unix file system, then checked the code into the
change tracking system, then prepared and tested the makefiles and additional
scripts and also found a way to deliver the correct version of the java virtual
machine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>We did this in the
first two weeks of the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
trouble that HGWF was having I found out, was that they could not move code
toward production because completed code was the last step in their Water Fall
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a step they never did
reach before being canceled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The XP
benefit here was that we focused on the problem with a small bit of code and
answered one of biggest worries before any other code was written.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Next the team worked
on programming tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first story
the team focused on was the simplest story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The customer was interested in doing the most complex story first.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But they agreed that since the team was new,
we should ease into the heavy lifting with a warm-up exercise.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The team was confident that they could build
the easy story within the first week so that was the estimate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And off we went to work!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>It was quickly clear
to the programmers that this simple task was going to involve more than they
expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We needed to build a whole
infrastructure and design to support talking to CORBA and the Oracle database.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took two iterations to finish this first
small and simple story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The team was
worried: a simple story had taken two weeks and we had only 6 to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>On top of that, the
database administrators estimated that it would take 2-3 weeks to implement any
requested changes that we submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Weeks for each change! Our entire schedule was only 8 weeks!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>A minor panic wave swept over the
team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ok, I wondered aloud, how do you
do you evolve a design when the Database folks think in units of weeks?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried a few alternatives, including
storing all our objects in files or database BLOBs so that the schema would
never change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The architecture
standards experts rejected both alternatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Finally we decided to use the current schema’s from the mainframe
system, translate them into RDBS format and submit that to the DB
Administrators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As we finished Stories
we would send in additional requests and hope DB could respond.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was a lot of discussion about spending
extra time doing an up-front design so that we would “know” the schema.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But I kept asking: if we spend the extra
time now are we guaranteed that we will not need a last minute change?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact no amount of design now could have
predicted what we did eventually run into.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was good that the team agreed to simply move on to the coding at this
point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we coded we added patterns to
insulate the core design from the eventual database changes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>In order to continue
coding while waiting for the database schema to become available, we used a
number of strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We used the
TableModule concept from Martin Fowler’s upcoming book.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried using MockObjects but found that
they were too cumbersome for our needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Lastly we settled on using an in-memory HyperSQL<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>database. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>During the first few
weeks the team earnestly tried to add tests as they went.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But this was usually after the production
code was written.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took between 3 and
5 iterations until test-first had really proven itself in the minds of the
developers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The value of test-first
became clearer to the team as they struggled to integrate hourly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since we had two pairs working the pair
closer to having running tests would be the first to integrate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This made integrating easier for the pair
that was keeping up with their testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The easiest way to keep up with testing – as it turns out – is to do
test-first coding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is one of those
neat feedback loops in XP where it is easier for programmers to do the correct
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And when they do the wrong thing
they themselves suffer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The next step came
when they started Refactoring more often.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>Refactoring is usually introduced only after the team has seen the value
of testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So at about iteration 3, I
made them aware of code duplication that needed to be removed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>We talked about how we could add a better
design and then I paired with various team members to show the steps of
Refactoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first reaction of the
programmers was annoyance that instead of adding new feature code, we were
spending time in house keeping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon
they discovered that the tests were not sufficient to guard against problems
appearing during refactoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Occasionally they discovered that Refactoring surfaced hidden and subtle
bugs or code dependencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since they
already accepted the benefits of testing, they now came to see the benefits of
rigorous testing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During refactoring
the size of the code base rapidly diminished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>At first they found this discouraging because they had worked so hard on
writing that pile of code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Next they
were cheered by how easy it was becoming to add new features.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>At this point the
team was at about week 5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They had
accepted testing and refactoring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They
were adding missing tests and discovering refactoring opportunities on their
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Best of all, the XP productivity
boost had kicked-in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the next 3
weeks the team worked smoothly and with confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Adjustments in requirements occurred frequently with minimal
affect on the team moral or productivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
