Assessment v Certification<BR><TT>&gt; What they are saying is that the quality 
certificate itself has value<BR>&gt; independent of the value of conforming to a 
quality standard.<BR><BR>I was once part of an ISO 9001-certified software 
development company. The company went for the certification because one of its 
major customers was ISO-certified and needed all of the software it used in its 
certified process to come from certified vendors. The aim was not to improve 
quality (it didn't) but to get the certificate. We needed that certificate 
within some timeperiod or else... we would lose their 
business.<BR><BR>&gt;&nbsp; If you certify a standard and the certification 
becomes valuable,<BR>&gt; people will want the certificate and will want to 
achieve it as<BR>&gt; cost-effectively as possible.<BR><BR>After the successful 
audit, my manager claimed to everybody who would listen that he had "saved the 
day" by steering the auditors away from his development team. Says something 
about the value of the audit, if they didn't even see the developers. Says even 
more about the trust my manager had in his team :-)<BR><BR>&gt; How then can we 
assess companies to ensure that no 'cheating' occurs?<BR><BR>We should not look 
at *what we do* but to *what the results are*. Can we reliably, consistently, 
quickly deliver what customers need?<BR><BR>We could (and did) cheat by learning 
to give standard answers to audit questions; by generating analysis and design 
documents which meant nothing and were never looked at, but could be produced 
when the auditors asked for them.... We went through the motions of executing 
our theoretical process and that fooled the auditors, because we had all the 
right answers and all the right paperwork.<BR><BR>What we couldn't fake: bug 
counts remained high; projects slipped continuously; projects got released when 
management got fed up with the interminable testing/bug fixing periods; code and 
design was awful; customer satisfaction decreased with each release... But the 
auditors were not interested in those measurements.<BR><BR>The ironic thing is: 
I'm sure that the easiest and cheapest way to get any kind of quality 
certification, is to actually improve your process and your product. That way 
you don't have to teach everybody to give the right answers, they can just give 
the real answers. And it makes everybody happier: customers, developers, 
management.<BR><BR>So: ASK NOT WHAT WE DO, LOOK AT THE RESULTS.<BR><BR>Pascal
