Hi! This is Nick, author of the Cactus content in Java Tools...

I intended the source code that appeared in Chapter 8 and the reference section
as "throw-away" examples, but readers (the customer) have told me that my
intuition about their needs was wrong. I guess I should practice XW --Extreme
Writing. In any case, here is the source.

I find myself in the middle of another book and I haven't
found the time to organize the Chapter 8 misc. source into a deployable unit.
Sorry... If I get several requests from readers for me to package it, I'll make
the time. I would also welcome any contributions of a build script,
instructions, dependencies, etc.

You can contact me at: ndlesiecki@apache.org
