<P>General Conferences like OOPSLA are good for general learning that eventually trickles down into better software systems. The trouble is engineers tend to be excessively practical people and "general learning" get tossed into the same pile as Art History.</P>
<P>So, the challenge that I will attempt to satisfy is to make some specific suggestions for our VAD group based on things learned at the conference. First though I will talk in general about the conference. But don't worry, I'll minimize the references to Art History.</P>
<P>The format of OOPSLA allows for diverse topics while establishing themes. The themes for the conference were:</P>
<B><P>Patterns,</P>
<P>People, and</P>
<P>Java.</P>
</B><P>The unofficial themes were: </P>
<OL>

<LI>the methodology <U>notation</U> wars are over, </LI></OL>

<P>but the wars over <U>methodology</U> are dormant but not resolved,</P>
<P>(2) CORBA is everywhere,</P>
<P>(3) Microsoft was no where,</P>
<P>(4) Smalltalk is alive and growing.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="_Toc380807228">Patterns</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>Patterns and especially the Gamma95 patterns were cited in almost every technical discussion. The Gamma95 patterns have been accepted as a standard vocabulary to build upon. Discussions of new patterns cited Gamma95 patterns and then extended them or contrasted with them. Christopher Alexander, an archetect of buildings and originator of</P>
<P>the idea of Patterns, gave the Tuesday keynote address. Two of the three parts of Alexander's talk are caputured in his intro to a newly published book by Richard Gabiel, "Patterns Of Software". The talk first covered patterns in architecture.</P>
<P>He asserts that modern buildings are being built merely for economic reasons and lack a living-structure. Living structures make us feel more human and healthy. </P>
<P>The second part covered Alexander's more recent attempt to develop metrics to objectively quantify the living-structure of spaces. In the third part of the talk, Alexander presented the software community with the challenge to add the life-giving qualities of good patterns into our software systems. While we should continue to try building error-free solutions for users, we should also consider the broader human implications of the applications that we thrust into the faces and lives of people. Just like living in a house can be healthy or unhealthy for the human spirit, working all day with an application can cause the same effects. This is an interesting challenge. I don't understand it completely, but I believe it deserves a bit of reflection on our part.</P>

</B></FONT><P>People issues in OO (as well as non-OO) software development are getting more attention in software engineering circles. These issues were discussed in various sessions. Larry Constantine who did early work on structured development methods and who more recently has worked as a Family Counselor, gave the Thursday keynote address. Constantine pointed out the importance of good GUI metaphors. And warned about poor metaphors that distract users from the work at hand. One example was the rolodex metaphor that he saw implemented in a software package where the rolodex tabs were printed on the screen vertically (just like on a real rolodex). And the opposite page was printed upside down (just like on a real rolodex). He presented a methodology he is developing that involves the user in multiple phases of the project and in very specific ways. This he believes will help focus our attention on the users needs more directly. </P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="_Toc380807230">Java</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>Whenever two software developers get together anymore "Java" is mentioned. OPPSLA was no exception. James Gosling gave the Wednesday keynote address on the development concerns that lead to the creation of Java.</P>
<P>Java (like Elvis) is everywhere. Most discussions made some mention of how Java changes things. There seemed to be a note of comfort with the growth of Java technology. While Java seems to take the middle ground between C++ and Smalltalk, it seems like there will be more movement from C++ to Java than from Smalltalk to Java. While Java has adopted many Smalltalk ideas Java has not adopted Smalltalk's unique image technology or its dynamic typing. But while Java has taken C-like syntax it has discarded most of C++'s ideas and features. Java has no 'C' compatibility, no pointer arithmetic, no unrooted hierarchy, no hardware dependency, and Java has dumped the rotten C++ idea of multiple implementation inheritance. One questioner asked James Gosling (Java's inventor) if he thought Java validated the Smalltalk approach to application building. Gosling replied that yes he liked Smalltalk quite a lot but Java had different goals than Smalltalk (strong type checking for example). Strong type checking via interfaces can be quite handy for designing type abstractions.</P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc380807231"></P></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>(1) The Notation Wars Are Over</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>The Unified Method Language (UML) is well on its way toward becoming an OMG standard. Its only competition is a proposal from the Open Consortium which does not have much backing. The goal of the UML is to provide a common notation for all methodologies. The focus is on "notation". UML will not provide a Unified Methodology, just a unified methodology Language. Some people thought that the standardization should go further and include a methodology, and while some worried that the UML went too far and would stifle innovation. I suppose I feel that it's just about right. I don't think that the OMG will have a very easy time standardizing a methodology anytime soon. There are still too many unresolved issues around methodology.</P>
<P>There was surprisingly little clarification about what would happen to the current OMT, Booch, and OOSE methodologies. Since the focus was on notation it's not clear what will happen to the methodologies themselves.</P>
<P>Two methodologies that hi-lighted new innovations were Fusion and Catalysis.</P>
<P>Fusion is the most precise and measurable of the leading methods. Fusion announced that it will be adopting the UML as it's notation and continuing to refine it's methodology to include support for distributed team development and architectural planning. It was good to see that methodologies were still evolving even though the industry is currently focused on a standalone notation.</P>
<P>Catalysis is a OODesign methodology based on OMT and Fusion. Catalysis uses the Java concept of interfaces as a bridge between design and coding. This methodology incorporates a more extendable and flexible mapping from Use-Cases to Design to Code. The focus of Catalysis is not on Classes but on the collaborations among classes and actors. This is a truly helpful idea. The trouble with OO's focus on classes is that classes on their own are NOT easily extendable. A quick look through the Gamma95 patterns and you will see that in most cases adding functionality requires the addition of multiple collaborating classes. What Catalysis does is to capture the interacting collaborations and lets you extend collaborations. These collaborations are represented in the form of Java interfaces. Interfaces provide the typing mechanism. While typing is available in C++ in the form of abstract classes, C++ mingles the concepts of class and interface in a blurry way while Java provides a greater clarity that is helpful in design. This provides Java with an advantage over Smalltalk when rigorous and precise design is required.</P>
<P>Two other methodologies to watch for are:</P>
<P>OCTOPUS for Embedded systems.</P>
<P>ROOM for Real Time Systems.</P>
<P>I don't know anything about them but there were mentioned in a few sessions.</P>
<P>The bottom line on methodologies is that none of the more wide spread methodologies are perfect. There is much work to be done. The heuristics of the most popular methods are incomplete. Caspers-Jones recently reported that 50% of OO projects abandon OO during development. I believe that the cause of this is the missing and disconnected heuristics of the most popular methodologies. HP's Fusion provides the best heuristics and best control of the process. But just like programming languages there will be a need for general purpose methodologies and special purpose methodologies. Where the special purpose methodologies will have a focus on embedded systems, real time systems, distributed development, etc... The notation will at least be standardizing on UML.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="_Toc380807232">(2) CORBA is everywhere,</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>CORBA 2.0 was widely discussed at the conference. There were a number of intro tutorials and workshops on CORBA issues. There was a lot less talk about Microsoft's DCOM architecture than about CORBA. At least among Object enthusiasts CORBA has won. It might be that DCOM folks all stayed away from OOPSLA because they were up all night debugging (non-Object) ActiveX components. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT> </P>

</B></FONT><P>It was surprising to me that Microsoft skipped the conference. Although most folks did use MS-PowerPoint for their presentations. Ironically, Windows95 crashed during one of the talks (chuckle-chuckle) and we had to wait for the PC to cold-boot. Even though Microsoft is not a leader in OO technology I still expected to see some MS presence. </P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc380807234"></P></A><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4>(4) Smalltalk is alive and growing.</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>One of the questions I had before the conference was "Is there life for Smalltalk after Java". The answer was a reassuring "yup". As I mentioned above the goals and uses of Java and Smalltalk are different. Both are useful in different ways. Java's strong type checking and concept of interface is good for well designed and rigorously modeled applications. While Smalltalk remains the king when time-to-market and maintenance are important.</P>
<P>A number of Smalltalk innovations were shown including:</P><DIR>

<P>(1) Java and HTML serving. Route1 allows the development of complex application logic with Smalltalk on the server with Java presentation on the client. VisualWave allows for automatic HTML screen generation from Smalltalk applications that need no special coding at all. </P>
<P>(2) Better packaging technology allowing smaller image sizes making possible utilities and applets are now as small as 30-200K and simple GUI applications as small as 500K.</P>
<P>(3) New tools to measure software complexity that would be difficult and expensive to implement in a language that has no image. Smalltalk metrics are available for code complexity, collaborators, comments, etc.</P></DIR>

<OL START=4>

<LI>Implementations of Smalltalk on the mainframe now allow very large scale systems.</LI>
<LI VALUE=1>IBM Smalltalk version 4.0 will support *HP-UX* and *Sun*. This finally gives Unix users an alternative to ParcPlace. And IBM uses X-Windows standards for its graphical classes. This makes it easier to learn for Unix programmers.</LI></OL>

<P>In all, Smalltalk is quite healthy. It is particularly strong in testing design ideas early in development. There may be a great combination of using Smalltalk to test a design and Java to cast the fully tested design in stone.</P><DIR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Specific Suggestions</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>At the beginning of this report I promised a list of specific suggestions. Well here goes…. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Java and Smalltalk are both gaining in acceptance. Keep a close eye on Java. Learn how to design with it and develop some smaller projects with it. The promise of Java is not being fulfilled by the current tools but that will change. The promise of Java is not its cross-platform ability, Smalltalk accomplished that a decade ago. The <U>promise of Java is the design aid</U> provided by the strongly-typed interfaces and the implementation aid provided by memory management. It is when paired with a rigorous design process that Java will really show it’s worth. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Notation and Methodologies are developing. Establish a process for all new product initiatives. Similar Use-Case, Analysis, and Design documents should be available for all projects. While most of the methodologies leave you stranded half-way through Fusion gives a step-by-step plan. Therefore, I recommend that you use the new <U>Unified Modeling Language notation and Fusion as the methodology</U>. With a defined design process you will be better positioned to take advantage of Java as noted above. With a defined design process it is possible to predict delivery and development cost with greater accuracy. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In projects that require a quick pay-off and <U>quick time-to-market</U>, consider <U>Smalltalk</U> to enhance productivity. The tools and techniques are very mature, complete, and well tested (compared to the unstable Java and the temperamental &amp; complex C++) . The technology being added to Smalltalk will help with packaging and delivery of smaller, faster images. </P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="_Toc380807236">Conclusion</A></P>
</B></FONT><P>The themes of OOPSLA were: Patterns, People, and Java. The unofficial themes were: the notation wars are over, CORBA is everywhere, Microsoft was nowhere, and Smalltalk is healthy. My suggestions are: use Java when paired with rigorous design of types, use Smalltalk when time-to-market is the prime consideration. It's a good time to begin using a methodology with clear and complete heuristics and a standard notation. The Unified Method Language notation and the Fusion methodology make a good combination.</P>
